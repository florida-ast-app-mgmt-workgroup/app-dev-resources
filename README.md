# API Resources
By providing rich and interactive documentation which also includes the ability for developers to explore and execute live calls against the API, use of API sandboxes can allow API producers to strongly enhance functionality and ease-of-use for potential developers.  This speeds early adoption and rewards users with a more fluid experience.  Greater adoption then results in a higher return on investment, a more vibrant developer community, and greater momentum for the API program.
